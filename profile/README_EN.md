## Natural Disasters Combat Initiative (DOMI)

The Natural Disasters Combat Initiative is an organization that produces open-source software for use in disasters throughout Turkey. Our goals can be summarized in several points.

### Objectives:

- Provision of necessary resources for civil organizations before earthquakes.
- Strengthening awareness about earthquakes.
- Providing online educational materials for civilian earthquake preparedness.
- Development of software that can benefit people during and after earthquakes, to be made available for public use.
- ...

### Open Source:

Everything we do is 100% open to everyone. Those who contribute to the project cannot obtain financial gain from the projects. However, the importance of donations in reaching our projects to the public should not be underestimated. If you wish to show your support through donations, you will be able to do so when our initiative reaches a certain maturity.

### Invitation to Developers:

The initiative you are currently reading about is a relatively young structure. If you want to join us and help with projects from inception to public release or at any stage, we invite you to our [Zulip](https://domi-turkiye.zulipchat.com/) channel. You will realize that most of the conversations are being held in Turkish. Don't be discouraged, there are surely many English speakers among us.
